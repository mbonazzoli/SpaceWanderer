## Questions and Answers

Q) Can this be played on a computer?

A) Yes and no. You can run the game on a computer, but unless your computer has touch built in, then you won't be able to jump. Ideally, we would publish a desktop verision of the game. Feel free to make one for yourself!

Q) What's the point of the game? 

A) You control the prince and you tap on a planet you would like to go. You keep tapping away while enjoying the background music and the hand drawn artwork. You don't have to do multiple taps, swipes, or any fancy finger movement. A simple tap will do. 

Q) How is this a game if it has no objectives, missions, or scores?

A)  We believe the game itself is playable because its simple premise will entice users to come back, do some jumps, and go back to their regular lives. Planet exploration via jumps is addicting.
